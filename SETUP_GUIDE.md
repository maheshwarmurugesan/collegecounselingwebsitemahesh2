# Complete Development Environment Setup Guide
## For Absolute Beginners 🚀

Welcome! This guide will help you set up everything step by step.

---

## ✅ What You Already Have

- ✅ **Cursor** - You're using it right now! This is a code editor.
- ✅ **Your first Python file** - `mahesh.py` is ready to go!

---

## 📋 Step 1: Install Command Line Tools (REQUIRED)

**What is this?** Command Line Tools are needed for Python to work on Mac. It's NOT the full Xcode (24GB) - just the tools (~860MB).

### Option A: GUI Installation (EASIEST - Recommended)

1. A dialog box should appear on your screen asking to install Command Line Tools
2. Click **"Install"** (NOT "Get Xcode")
3. Enter your Mac password when asked
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for installation
5. You're done! ✅

### Option B: Terminal Installation

If the dialog didn't appear, open Terminal and run:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Then follow the dialog that appears.

### Option C: Direct Install (If you prefer)

Open Terminal and run:
```bash
sudo softwareupdate --install "Command Line Tools for Xcode-16.4"
```
Enter your password when asked.

## 🧪 Step 2: Test Python (After Command Line Tools Install)

Once Command Line Tools are installed, we'll test if Python works.

**To test, run this command in Terminal:**
```bash
cd ~/Coding
python3 mahesh.py
```

You should see:
```
Hello, World!
This is Mahesh's Python script.
```

---

## 📦 Step 3: What You'll Have After Setup

After completing Step 1, you'll be able to:

- ✅ Run Python scripts in Cursor
- ✅ Use Python with Claude (AI assistant in Cursor)
- ✅ Write and run code
- ✅ Set up VS Code (optional, you already have Cursor which is similar)

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

If anything doesn't work:
1. Make sure Command Line Tools installation completed
2. Try closing and reopening Terminal
3. Ask for help - I'm here to guide you!

## 🎯 Next Steps After Setup

Once Python is working, you can:
- Write more Python scripts
- Learn programming basics
- Build projects
- Use Claude AI to help you code
