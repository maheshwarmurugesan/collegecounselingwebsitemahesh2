## 🎯 Your First Coding Exercise (Do This Now!)

Let's make your first interactive Python program together!

### Step 1: Edit Your Python File

1. **Open `mahesh.py`** (you already have it open!)
2. **Replace everything** with this code:

```python
# My First Interactive Program
name = input("What's your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")

print(f"\nHello, {name}!")
print(f"You are {age} years old.")
print("Welcome to Python programming! 🎉")
```

3. **Save the file** (Cmd + S)

### Step 2: Run It!

1. **Open Terminal in Cursor:** Press `` Ctrl + ` `` (backtick key)
2. **Type:**
   ```bash
   python3 mahesh.py
   ```

## 🔥 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start Small
- Don't try to build everything at once
- Start with simple programs
- Build up gradually

### Tip 2: Ask Lots of Questions
- "What does this mean?"
- "How does this work?"
- "Can you explain this code?"
- There are no stupid questions!

### Tip 3: Experiment!
- Change numbers and see what happens
- Try breaking things (then ask me to fix them!)
- Copy code and modify it

### Tip 4: Use Comments
Add comments (lines starting with #) to remember what code does:
```python
# This asks for the user's name
name = input("What's your name? ")

# This prints a greeting
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
