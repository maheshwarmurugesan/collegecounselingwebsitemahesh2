## 🎯 How Python Works in Cursor

**Cursor is your code editor** - you write Python code here.
**Terminal runs your code** - you execute Python scripts there.

Think of it like this:
- 📝 **Cursor** = Where you WRITE code (like a word processor for code)
- 💻 **Terminal** = Where you RUN code (executes your Python scripts)
