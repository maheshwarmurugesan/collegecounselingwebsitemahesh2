1. Open files in **Cursor** (your code editor)
2. Write or edit your code
3. Save the file (Cmd + S)

### Running Code:
1. Open **Terminal**
2. Go to your folder: `cd ~/Coding`
3. Run your script: `bash run.sh` or `python3 mahesh.py`

### Getting Help:
- Type `bash help.sh` in Terminal - shows all commands
- Ask **Claude** in Cursor - it can help you code!
- Read the guides (README.md, QUICK_START.md)
