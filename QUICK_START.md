# 🎉 Quick Start Guide - You're Ready!

## ✅ Great News!

**Python is already working on your computer!** You can start coding right now!

## 🚀 Run Your First Script

Open Terminal (press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter) and run:

```bash
cd ~/Coding
python3 mahesh.py
```

You should see:
```
Hello, World!
This is Mahesh's Python script.
```

**Congratulations! You just ran your first Python program! 🎉**

## 📝 How to Write and Run Python Code

### Step 1: Write Code in Cursor
- Open `mahesh.py` in Cursor (you're already doing this!)
- Edit the code
- Save the file (Cmd + S)

### Step 2: Run the Code
- Open Terminal
- Navigate to your folder: `cd ~/Coding`
- Run your script: `python3 mahesh.py`

## 🎯 What's Next?

### Learn Python Basics:
1. **Variables** - Store information
   ```python
   name = "Mahesh"
   age = 25
   ```

2. **Print statements** - Display information
   ```python
   print("Hello, " + name)
   print(f"You are {age} years old")
   ```

3. **Get user input**
   ```python
   name = input("What's your name? ")
   print(f"Hello, {name}!")
   ```

### Try This:
Edit `mahesh.py` and add:
```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Python!")
```

Then run it again!
